SETUP
-----

* Unit and Xform Benchmarks commented out
* Angle Bencharks uncommented
* Visual instance running with type-safety.sln, benchmark set to start-up project, ReleaseStatic version
* Another Visual instance running with compilation-benchmark.sln
* Developer Command Prompt running in compilation-benchmark/build
* Notepad++ with both ASMComparison files open
* Godbolt with listings loaded

Angle "free" example
--------------------

* Show Angle.hpp
* show benchmark/Angle.cpp
* run benchmark, show that times for float and angle are the same
* open AngleAsmComparison.cpp, compile it and open AngleAsmComparison.asm. Show that callFloats and callAngles are the same. Mention that when looked at debug version one of the functions actually got removed
* switch to debug
* run benchmark, show that angle is slower than float
* open AngleAsmComparison.cpp, compile it and open AngleAsmComparison.asm. Mention that functions are no longer inlined
* open compilation-benchmark, show angle and angle-float code
* open dev command prompt, run:
** Msbuild.exe compilation-benchmark.sln /p:Configuration=Release /t:angle-float:Rebuild
** Msbuild.exe compilation-benchmark.sln /p:Configuration=Release /t:angle:Rebuild
** Msbuild.exe compilation-benchmark.sln /p:Configuration=Release /t:angle-pch:Rebuild

Unit "free" example
-------------------

* Show Unit.hpp
* show test/Unit.cpp EarthGravitationalAcceleration (bottom)
* comment-out Angle benchmark, uncomment Unit benchmark
* run benchmark for both release and debug
* open UnitAsmComparison, compile it

Xform example
-------------

* Show Space.hpp, Xform.hpp
* comment-out Unit benchmark, uncomment Xform benchmark
* run benchmark for both release and debug for both DO_SPACE_RUNTIME_CHECKS and not (space.hpp:4)
* show xform on godbolt, show that assembly is the same
